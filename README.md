# rmp3
Idiomatic `no_std` bindings to [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3) which don't allocate.

## Usage
A simple streaming iterator is provided for decoding samples.

```rust
let mut decoder = rmp3::Decoder::new(&your_data_here);

// It returns a reference to the internal fixed buffer along with the frame info:
while let Some(rmp3::Frame { channels, sample_rate, samples, .. }) = decoder.next_frame() {
    // * process frame data here *
}

// Sometimes you just want to iterate the frames without decoding them, as it's much faster.
// Example to calculate song length - 800Âµs vs. 350ms when decoding a 4:52 track (on a low-end CPU)
let mut length = 0.0f32; // length in seconds
while let Some(rmp3::Frame { sample_rate, sample_count, .. }) = decoder.peek_frame() {
    // Not all frames necessarily contain samples (next_frame would skip over these).
    if sample_count != 0 {
        length += sample_count as f32 / sample_rate as f32;
    }
    decoder.skip_frame();
}
```

## Features
- `float` - Output 32-bit float PCM instead of signed 16-bit integers
- `no-simd` - Disable all manual SIMD optimizations
- `only-mp3` (default) - Strip MP1/MP2 decoding logic
